    <h1>Do smartphones have a place in the classroom?</h1>
    <p class="longarticle"><i>
        My opinion of smartphones in the classroom is divided. I do believe kids should be allowed to use their smart phones in the classroom but only every 5 minutes. "Smartphones can be used as a way to Keep Students Happy", as seen <a target="_blank" href="https://kwikboost.com/7-reasons-students-allowed-use-cell-phones-school/">here</a>.<br>The kids should not be allowed to constantly use their smartphones as this will be a very big distraction. I believe smartphones should be allowed in classrooms through years 0-8 because we are more immature and will do silly things with our smartphones. I also believe that "Students can learn in a way they are comfortable" as seen <a target="_blank" href="https://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/classroom-resources/should-students-use-their-smartphones-as-learning-tools/">here</a>.<br> However once we reach year 9 and beyond we start to get more mature and will use our smartphones more responsibly. Although some kids will not use these smartphones responsibly and could be "Used as a distraction" as seen <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oxfordlearning.com/should-cell-phones-be-allowed-classrooms/">here</a>.<br> I believe every kid should be trusted 100% with their smartphones but every time they are caught missbehaving should lose trust with the teacher or have a punishment. I believe that having "mandatory cell phone collection boxes, and awarding students whom the teacher believes has made the best use of his or her phone during class" would be the best outcome as seen </i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.learningliftoff.com/smartphones-in-the-classroom/">here</a><br>
